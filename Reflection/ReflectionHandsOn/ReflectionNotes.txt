Reflection is the process of describing the metadata of types, methods and fields in a code. 
The namespace System.Reflection enables you to obtain data about the loaded assemblies, the elements within them 
like classes, methods and value types.

Matadata : 
Informs about Data of a Data. ie. number of or name of properties and methods in a dll files.

A scenerio where: runtime only i want to access/invoke a method or create an object before that if class name is Course then only i want to
invoke otherwise not. so using reflection we can easily do this .
