WHAT IS ADO.NET?
ADO.NET stands for ActiveX Data Objects which is Microsoft technology. The main job that handles ADO.NET is data management. 
It is widely used for accessing, selecting, saving, deleting or managing data with the database. 
Ado.net is a data bridge between your apps and databases that carry data between them. Ado.net has a rich set of classes, methods, and interfaces 
that allow you to handles data in the database more efficiently.

>>ADO.NET is a set of classes that allows you to connect and work with data sources like databases, excel file, access file, xml file, mysql, 
sql or notepad. To connect your application with different sources of database you need to know the right Data Provider. 
There are several Data Providers in ADO.NET that connects with different types of sources. A list of ADO.NET Data Providers is listed below:


Data Provider	Description
SQL Server	    System.Data.SqlClient – This Data Provider is used to connect with SQL Server Databases.
OLEDB	        System.Data.OleDb – This Data Provider is used to connect with SQL Server, Oracle and Microsoft Jet.

>>CORE COMPONENTS OF .NET DATA PROVIDERS
There are 4 Core Components of .Net Data Providers that is used to connect, access and retrieve data from the database. You need to memorize 
these 4 core components of ADO.Net.

1. Connection – This component is used for connecting to the database. The base class is DbConnection.
2. Command – This component executes SQL query against the data source. The base class is DbCommand.
3. DataReader – It reads data from data source. It accesses data read-only and forward-only. The base class is DbDataReader.
4. DataAdapter – It invokes dataset and resolves updates with the data source. The base class is DbDataAdapter.



>>WHAT IS CONNECTION OBJECT IN ADO.NET?
Connection Object is used for connecting your application to data source or database. It carries required authentic information 
like username and password in the connection string and opens a connection. You need to different type of connection object for 
different type of data providers. For example:

OLE DB – OleDbConnection
SQL Server – SqlConnection
ODBC – OdbcConnection
Oracle – OracleConnection


>>WHAT IS CONNECTION STRING?
Connection String combines all the required authentic information that is used for connecting to a Data Source, 
like Server Name, Database Name, User Name, Password etc. 
It is just a single line string that is used by connection object to connect to the database. 
A connection string looks like this.

Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=TestDB;Integrated Security=True

or,
Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=TestDB;User ID=sa;Password=System123;Pooling=False
