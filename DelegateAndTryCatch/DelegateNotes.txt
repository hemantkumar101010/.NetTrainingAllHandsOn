What is a delegate?

It is a reference type.
It is a function pointer or it holds a reference (pointer) to a function (method).
It is type safe.
Delegates are mainly used for the event handling and the callback methods.


Delegate can be used to point to any function, which has a similar signature i.e., it can be used to point to any function, 
which has void return type and one string parameter.

There are two types of delegates, which are given below.

Unicast deligate:
This delegate refers to only one method.
Multicast deligate:
This delegate can refer to more than one method.

Note:
An instance of a delegate can refer to static as well as instance methods. 
The signature of function declaration and the delegate declaration should match.
