Serialization:  is the process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes and Deserialization is the process of converting a previously serialized sequence of bytes into an object. It enables you to save the state of an object and reconstruct it as needed.

Binary serialization
Steps for serializing an object are as follows:

1. Create a stream object.
2. Create a BinaryFormatter Object.
3. Call the BinaryFormatter.Serialize() method.


Steps for deserializing an object are as follows:

1. Create a stream object to read the serialized output.
2. Create a BinaryFormatter object.
3. Call the BinaryFormatter.Deserialize() method to deserialize the object, and cast it to the correct type.
