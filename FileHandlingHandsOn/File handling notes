What is a File?
A file is a collection of data stored on a disk with a specific name, extension, and directory path. 
When you open File using C# for reading and writing purposes it becomes Stream.


What is Stream?
A stream is a sequence of bytes traveling from a source to a destination over a communication path. There are two main streams: the input stream and the output stream. 
The input stream is used for reading data from the file (read operation) and the output stream is used for writing into the file (write operation). 
There are two types of streams are used:

Input stream: This stream is used to read data from a file, which is known as a read operation.
Output stream: This stream is used to write data into a file, which is known as a write operation.


File Handling in C#
Generally, we use the file to store data. The term File Handling in C# refers to the various operations that we can perform on a file such as creating a file, 
reading data from the file, writing data into the file, appending the file, etc.

Generally, two basic operations we mostly perform on a file that is reading data from a file and writing data to a file. 
One more thing that you need to remember the file becomes a stream when we open the file either for writing or for reading.
